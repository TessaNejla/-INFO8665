# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Web App

## Objective
This project is a Streamlit web application designed for analyzing and predicting stock market data. The application provides various features for visualizing stock performance and predicting future prices using an LSTM model.

## Features

### Stock Data Retrieval
- Utilizes `yfinance` to fetch historical stock data.
- Predefined list of popular stock tickers: `AAPL`, `META`, `NVDA`, `NFLX`.
- Users can select multiple stock tickers for analysis.

### User Inputs
- **Stock Tickers Selection**: Choose from predefined popular tickers or input custom tickers.
- **Date Range Selection**: Customize the start and end dates for analysis.
- **Analysis Type Selection**: Options include Closing Prices, Volume, Moving Averages, Daily Returns, Correlation Heatmap, and Distribution of Daily Changes.
- **Additional Information Options**: Users can opt to display Stock Actions, Quarterly Financials, Institutional Shareholders, Quarterly Balance Sheet, Quarterly Cashflow, Analysts Recommendation, and Predicted Prices.

### Data Visualization
- **Closing Prices**: Line chart visualization.
- **Volume**: Line chart visualization.
- **Moving Averages**: Line charts of 20-day and 50-day moving averages.
- **Daily Returns**: Line chart of the daily returns.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Heatmap of correlations between selected stocks.
- **Distribution of Daily Changes**: Histogram of daily changes in stock prices.

### Additional Information
- **Stock Actions**: Corporate actions such as dividends and stock splits.
- **Quarterly Financials**: Financial reports on a quarterly basis.
- **Institutional Shareholders**: Information on major shareholders.
- **Quarterly Balance Sheet**: Quarterly balance sheet data.
- **Quarterly Cashflow**: Quarterly cash flow data.
- **Analysts Recommendation**: Recommendations and ratings from financial analysts.

### Price Prediction
- **LSTM Model**: Predict future stock prices using an LSTM model.
  - Historical data is scaled and split into training and test sets.
  - Model trained on 95% of data and validated on the remaining 5%.
  - Predictions are visualized alongside actual prices.
### Advanced Analysis:
- **Chaikin Oscillator
- **Stochastic Oscillator
**Stochastic Oscillator and Price
**MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
**RSI (Relative Strength Index)

## Task Breakdown
1. **Identify reliable market data APIs**
2. **Develop scripts/tools for data ingestion**
3. **Clean and preprocess collected data**
4. **Standardize data formats**
5. **Explore data visualization techniques**
6. **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
7. **Extract relevant features from raw financial data**
8. **Implement data transformation techniques**
9. **Split the preprocessed data into training, validation, and test sets**
10. **Document data collection and preprocessing procedures**
    - Keep thorough documentation of each step for reproducibility.

## Documentation

### Data Collection
- Data sourced from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance` library.
- Predefined list of popular stock tickers: `AAPL`, `META`, `NVDA`, `NFLX`.
- Customizable time period via user input.

### Data Preprocessing
- Filled missing values using forward fill.
- Added moving averages (20-day and 50-day) for selected analysis.
- Calculated daily returns and daily changes.

### Data Standardization
- Ensured consistent date format.
- Handled missing values using appropriate methods.

### Data Visualization
- **Closing Prices**: Line chart of the closing prices.
- **Volume**: Line chart of the trading volume.
- **Moving Averages**: Line charts of 20-day and 50-day moving averages.
- **Daily Returns**: Line chart of the daily returns.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Heatmap of the correlations between selected stocks.
- **Distribution of Daily Changes**: Histogram of the daily changes in stock prices.

### Feature Extraction
- Calculated daily returns and moving averages.
- Analyzed correlations between stock returns using heatmaps.

### Data Splitting
- Split data into training and test sets for model validation.

### Model Building
- **LSTM Model for Price Prediction**:
  - Built an LSTM model using `keras` to predict future stock prices.
  - Trained on 95% of historical data and tested on the remaining 5%.

## Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive analysis of stock market data using Python. Key takeaways include:
- Retrieving and processing stock data using `yfinance`.
- Visualizing stock data trends with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Implementing an LSTM model to predict future stock prices.
- Evaluating additional financial information for deeper insights.

By leveraging these techniques, users can gain a better understanding of stock performance and make informed investment decisions.
